	Obstacles :Just a conflict of who wants to do what, and whether or not everyone has their desired load of work.

Oct 31, 2018
	Yesterday :I got assigned to create the line thickness selector, which is user story 7.
	Today     :Working on creating the line thickness selector. Plan is to take about 2 hours to finish this story.
	Obstacles :Decided that we would like to create a pop up which selects the line thickness. However I am having trouble implementing this thing properly, without changing too much starting code. 

Nov 1, 2018
	Yesterday :Worked on Line thickness selector, created the selector button on the right column, and also figured out a way to change the line thickness, just have to make the button do something to the line now. 
	Today     :No meaningful update has been made to the code.
	Obstacles :Time constraints, have CSC236 due tomorrow, MAT232 due Sunday, MAT232 quiz Monday, and STA256 Tuesday, somehow have to manage time for and get everything done. 

Nov 2, 2018
	Yesterday :No meaningful update to the code.
	Today     :Got somewhere, made a separate class for a thickness selector, sort of similar to shape selector.
	Obstacles :Still don't know  how to implement it.

Nov 3, 2018
	Yesterday :Created separate class for line thickness selector.
	Today     :Implemented line thickness selector. Created sizes of thickness each of them work.
	Obstacles :Very minor bug, the counter implemented in the starter code also gets an increased thickness with the selection of the line thickness

Nov 4, 2018
	Yesterday :Implemented line thickness selector
	Today     :Implemented line thickness selector for all working shapes.
	Obstacles :Fixed all merging conflicts between master and branch, all working shapes will be able able to adjust thickness.

	Today     :Fixed thickness bug with square and rectangle
	Obstacles :Issue with poly line and squiggle still remains, merging the buildpath also remains an issue.

Nov 9, 2018
	Yesterday :implemented thickness for shapes
	Today     :implemented thickness for all lines and shapes, thickness implementation complete.
	Obstacles :Still an issue with polyline, but it is non-thickness related.

	Today     :Started java doc, fixed minor bug
	Obstacles :had to work on fixing the UI for thickness
	
Nov 11, 2018

	Obstacles :Couldn't really figure out how to create a listener for the slider with all the changes.
	
Nov 12, 2018
	Yesterday :Started working on thickness slider.
	Today     :Completed thickness slider. 
	Obstacles :Had to take a little assistance from my team mates to see where i was going wrong.
