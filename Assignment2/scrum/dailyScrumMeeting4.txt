Nov 1, 2018
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Started working on the user story 5, trying to create a new window from a drop down menu option so that there's a seperate window to select shape colors.
	Obstacles : Had some difficulty with getting a second window to open from another window. Is something that needs to be worked on. Also need to figure out how to pass values from a child window to a parent window.

Nov 2, 2018
	Yesterday : Started working on user story 5 yesterday, was struggling with how to open a second window.
	Today     : Managed to create a child window that is dedicated to setting colors, with 3 different sliders in place to decide RGB values and a select button that changes color to reflect the color given by the slider. This window is now capable of sending the desired RGB value to each individual drawable item so that each thing drawn has its own color.
	Obstacles : Small bug in that I don't know how to change the color when the shape is still being formed (i.e. when dragging), something to fix in the future.

Nov 8, 2018
	Yesterday : Cleaned up color picking code to seperate it from the the PaintModel code.
	Today     : Worked on Bug 8, made some progress, but still confused on how to implement it.
	Obstacles : Not a lot of progress made today since I was confused on how to properly implement command pattern into the code.

Nov 9, 2018
	Yesterday : Not a lot of progress made in Bug 8 since I'm still learning how it works
	Today     : Still learning how to implement command pattern for Bug 8, have finished the majority of it, but holding off pushing it to notify others.
	Obstacles : Still learning command pattern.

Nov 10, 2018
	Yesterday : Now realized that I was using the wrong code for the commands and implemented it wrong.
	Today     : Finally finished Bug 8 and ready to push, as well as wrote java docs for command pattern's, most of paintpanel's, and paintmodel's code.
	Obstacles : Finding the proper place to implement the invoker class (PropertyInvoker).
